# Space Shooter Game

Space shooter game built in Unity deployable to IOS. Can utilize both keyboard and touch input. As a ship flying through space, you must dodge asteroids, enemy ships, and other interstellar threats. 

You start out flying through space, encountering asteroids and debris that damage you when they hit your ship.

Then enemy ships will show up, shooting at you. However they don't appear to be able to move horizontally, and only come down stupidly down the screen for you to dodge and destroy them.

Get powerups such as a blue reload box that will make you shoot several times faster, blasting everything in your path.

But there is a constant drag on you as you fly through space! If you don't continue to boost yourself forward, you will drift back and continue to take damage. If you take too much damage this way or when you crash into asteroids/take damage from enemies, the game is over.
